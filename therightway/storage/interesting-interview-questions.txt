for anyone that gets "How often do you make mistakes" or "When's the last time you've made a mistake" respond w everyday or something like "probably an hour ago" and explain that you believe you can learn something new everyday, it hits w them bc they never expect it lol

An interesting question during a first interview these days seems to be “how many interviews does your company conduct before a decision?” Seems to be a 5-6 interview trend of late. And ask “is this representative of the company’s efficiency?” I’d love to hear that response.

They asked me, “Do you think you would be able to support yourself on this salary?”
I said, “Do you think you pay your employees a living wage?”
